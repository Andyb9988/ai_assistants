# ai_assistants Notes
Working through OpenAI API assistants https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHPonmSX4Ms&amp;t=1s

## What we will learn
- Function Calls
- Retrieval mechanisms

## Assistants API Benefits
**call with specific instructions**
OpenAI Models

**Access multiple tools in parallel**
- code interpreter
- knowledge retrieval
- function calling (create own tools)
- persistent threads (save message in conversation for context).
- Access files

**Assistants API Building Blocks**
- Assistant (e.g. travel agent bot)
- Thread (messages between assistant and user are stored.)
- Run (Evaluates what is going on)
Has access to the assistant and to the thread.
Steps:
1. Use code interpreter
2. Create Message
3. Call another tool..
